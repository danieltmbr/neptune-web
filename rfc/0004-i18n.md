# Summary

Some of Neptune Web components have default and/or hardcoded messages which needs to be localised.

In this RFC we describe proposel using react-intl library, Crowdin along with a custom context provider component.

# Motivation

Components have text that is not likely to be changed, text that we are able to anticipate, optional text that has a default value. Those cases are not that many but we still have them and at the moment they are not localised at all:

- The `aria-label` on a close button ("Close"); next and previous buttons in a pagination component ("Previous" and "Next").
- Messages in upload component.
- ..

# Technical Details / Implementation

We propose to use react-intl library as API for managing translations of Neptune Web components with Crowdin integration in neptune-web repo for receiving new translated copies, with custom context provider that we called `NeptuneProvider` (for now this provide will only handle translations but in future it might be enhanced to handle also other global configurations (e.g Theming via `theme` prop)).

We decided to add `NeptuneProvider` on top of react-intl in order to decouple consumer's applications from a specific translation library. Consumers can continue using their existing translation library.

[Here you can see it's implementation]().

Example of changes in component's code:

```js
import { useIntl, FormattedMessage } from 'react-intl';

export const SomeComponent = ({ children, ... }) => {
  const intl = useIntl();
  return (
    <button
      aria-label={intl.formatMessage({ id: 'some.message.key' })}
      ...
    >
      <FormattedMessage key="another.message.key">
      {children}
    </button>
  );
};
```

On consumer side you should wrappar area where you Neptune components, usually it's at the top level component:

```js
class App {
  render() {
    return (
      <NeptuneProvider locale={'en'}>
        <Head>
          <title>Some Title</title>
        </Head>
        ...
      </NeptuneProvider>
    );
  }
}
```

NeptuneProvider can be defined next to other context providers of other libaries or even react-intl.

### Patterns & Conventions

Proposing keep length of keys as short as possible because they don't get minified so those things will add weight to the end bundle. Example of key:

```
np.c9n.btn.close.label
```

Where `np.c9n` is mandantory unique prefix, `np` stands for Neptune and `c9n` as shorthand for name of component CloseButton which this message belongs.

Try to use shorthand when ever possible without sacrificing readability e.g choose 'btn' over 'button'.
